# TripToNowhere_HSG
Project for HSG


In the Skills: Programming - Introduction Level course, we made a program for an end of semester project. The choice of the project was free. We decided to develop a game on Python with the use of Pygame. To write the program, we use the Atom editor. For the project, our group chose to develop a game based on the Doodle Jump model, a game we love. 

The goal is to bring a character as high as possible by making him jump from platform to platform, while avoiding the obstacles that arise during his ascent. The game board is rectangular; the character moves in the lower third. When he jumps, he follows a parabolic trajectory. In the ascending phase, he passes in front of the platforms, without collision. In the downward phase, he bounces on the platforms he encounters. From the beginning of the game, the character performs a movement that could make us think that the character wants to jump and bounce on all platforms. The player directs the jumps with the left and right arrows in a gradual manner. If the character reaches the bottom of the board without touching a platform, the game is lost. The game then starts again from the beginning. Each time the character passes the bottom third of the board in the ascending phase, the whole stage (the character and the platforms) is lowered automatically, so as to contain the character in the bottom third. When the character's trajectory crosses a vertical edge of the stage, he reappears on the other side, as if the stage were cylindrical. From time to time, a monster appears that you must avoid.

To launch the game, you need to download the file, Atom, pyton and pygame. Once these steps are completed, you must install the following packages:
- Ide-python
- Script

Then, place yourself in the Principal.py document and press Ctrl+Shift+B.
You can now enjoy the experience.
